Smart washing machine?

- i have a smart dishwasher which tell me when the dishwasher has finished - totally useless to me
- i have a washing machine that only way to alert me to the cycle being finished is agressive beeping.
- since moving it as far away as possible i no longer hear the beeping and now regularly go to fill the machine only to find that there a load from 2 days ago that has started to grow mushrooms. 
- Since i have no intention to buy a smart washing machine i plan to retro fit with this capability

Plan

1. Get a smart plug with power reading
2. Figure out approx power when idle and when running a cycle 
3. Write some pyton to send an alert to phone  using something like https://pushover.net/ to make life simple
4. [text](https://badgerbadgerbadgerbadger.dev/posts/misc/2024-04-08-is-it-dry-yet/)

- quite like the kasa stuff seems fairly cheap and has a decent python API
- bought a KP115 Â£27.99

Thoughts:
1. Dont want to worry about ip changing with DHCP so will use library discovery?
2. Polling to detect when cycle is running? 5 mins ?
3. This is seemingly a legacy device (running on port 9999) which has provides more info
